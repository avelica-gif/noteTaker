Description:

This is an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will uses an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

Business Context:

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

Technologies used in this application are:
-JavaScript
-Node.js
-Package.json(Express and UUID)

\*To this day I keep on having issues deplying to Heroku. But the app works locally.
